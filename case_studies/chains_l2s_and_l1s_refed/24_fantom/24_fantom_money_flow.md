# Fantom Money Flow Analysis: The Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model

## Executive Summary

Fantom operates a validator-centric fee distribution model where 70% of transaction fees flow to validators, 15% to applications through gas monetization, 10% to development, and 5% burned through the innovative Lachesis asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus mechanism. With 1.76-second finality, 180.6 TPS maximum throughput, and sub-$0.01 transaction costs, the network demonstrates superior performance through DAG-based consensus that eliminates traditional block time constraints. The December 2024 Sonic Network transition introduces 10,000 TPS capability with 90% storage reduction and 1:1 FTM-to-S token migration supported by $120 million developer funding. Fantom's unique position leverages fixed 3.175 billion FTM supply, 90% validator requirement reduction to 50,000 FTM ($20,000), and comprehensive DeFi ecosystem with $91.2 million TVL across protocols like Beethoven X and SpookySwap enabling Web2-style revenue sharing for applications.

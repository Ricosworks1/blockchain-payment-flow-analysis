# Fantom Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary
When users spend $1 on Fantom, fees flow to validators (~100%) through the unique Lachesis consensus mechanism and aBFT (asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance) architecture. Unlike traditional PoS networks, Fantom's Opera mainnet uses a DAG-based consensus where validators process transactions asynchronously, enabling high throughput and instant finality. This analysis traces fee distribution across Fantom's EVM-compatible, speed-optimized blockchain designed for DeFi and enterprise applications.

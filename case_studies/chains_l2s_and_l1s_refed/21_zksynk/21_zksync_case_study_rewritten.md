# zkSync Era Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary
When users spend $1 on zkSync Era, fees flow primarily to Matter Labs (centralized sequencer ~70%) with portions for Ethereum L1 proof verification (~25%) and the emerging decentralized prover network (~5%). The 2024 transition toward decentralized proving through partnerships like Lagrange marks a shift from fully centralized to hybrid architecture. This analysis traces fee distribution across zkSync's ZK-rollup infrastructure.

## Conclusion

zkSync Era currently operates a centralized model where Matter Labs captures approximately 70% of user fees through sequencer operation, with 25% going to Ethereum L1 for proof verification and 5% to proof generation. The 2024 integration of decentralized proving through partnerships like Lagrange marks the beginning of a transition toward distributed architecture. Planned sequencer decentralization in 2025 will fundamentally restructure fee flows from Matter Labs control to validator-based distribution. While current centralization enables efficient operation and development, the roadmap toward decentralization promises more equitable fee distribution and reduced MEV extraction, making zkSync more aligned with decentralized principles while maintaining ZK-rollup efficiency advantages.

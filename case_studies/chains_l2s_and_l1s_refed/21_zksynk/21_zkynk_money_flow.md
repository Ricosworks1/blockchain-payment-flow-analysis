# zkSync Era Money Flow Analysis: The ZK-Proof Scaling Model

## Executive Summary

zkSync Era operates a centralized sequencer model where Matter Labs captures majority transaction fees while transitioning toward decentralized proving through partnerships with Lagrange Labs and Fermah, representing 75% of proof outsourcing commitments over the next two years. With 1.5+ million daily transactions leading all Ethereum Layer 2s, $541 million TVL, and 16.11 average TPS performance, the network demonstrates strong technical execution despite centralized economics. The June 2024 ZK token launch (21 billion supply, $730 million market cap) and planned sequencer decentralization within one year establish foundation for community governance while maintaining ZK-rollup efficiency advantages. zkSync's unique position leverages SNARK-based proof systems, comprehensive DeFi ecosystem led by SyncSwap ($23.7 million TVL), and ambitious 2025 roadmap targeting 10,000+ TPS with $0.0001 transaction costs through elastic chain architecture.

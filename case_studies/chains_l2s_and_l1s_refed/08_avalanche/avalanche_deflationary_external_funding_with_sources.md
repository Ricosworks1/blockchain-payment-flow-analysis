# Avalanche - Deflationary with High External Funding

When users spend $1 on Avalanche, 100% of transaction fees are burned (removed from supply)[^1]. Validators earn zero from fees, instead receiving rewards from newly minted AVAX through inflation[^2]. Avalanche operates on $3-4B annually in external funding from the Avalanche Foundation, subnet incentives, VC investments, and programmatic token unlocks ($1-2B annually through 2030), creating a deflationary network sustained by external capital rather than fee redistribution[^3].

## When a user pays $1 in Avalanche fees:

### Direct Fee Recipients
- **Token Burn**: $1.00 (100% of fees burned via deflationary mechanism)[^4][^5]
- **Validators**: $0.00 from fees (rewards from inflation only)[^6][^7]

The complete fee burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure, with validators compensated through inflation rather than fee sharing[^8].

### Validator Funding
- **AVAX Staking Rewards**: Up to 7.65% APY from token inflation[^9][^10]
- **Daily Validator Payments**: ~$280,000 from new token issuance[^11]
- **No Fee Revenue**: All transaction fees permanently burned[^12]

### Foundation and VC Funding
- **Avalanche Foundation**: $200-500M for ecosystem development[^13][^14]
- **Subnet Incentives**: $100-300M for custom blockchain development[^15][^16]
- **Ava Labs**: $350M+ raised for core development[^17][^18]

### Token Unlock Schedule
- **Annual Token Unlocks**: $1-2B annually in programmatic releases[^19][^20]
  - **Staking Rewards**: 187.7M AVAX unlocking ($5.68B remaining, 30% unlocked)[^21]
  - **Team Allocation**: 72M AVAX ($2.18B remaining, 10% unlocked)[^22]
  - **Community**: 50.4M AVAX ($1.52B remaining, 30% unlocked)[^23]
  - **Strategic Partners**: 36M AVAX ($1.09B remaining, 80% unlocked)[^24]

## External Funding

$3-4B annually beyond user fees (Foundation ecosystem: $200-500M + Subnet incentives: $100-300M + Ava Labs development: $350M+ + Token unlocks: $1-2B + Additional VC investments: $350-850M)

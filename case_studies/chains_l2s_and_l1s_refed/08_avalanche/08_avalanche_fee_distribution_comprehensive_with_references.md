# Avalanche Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary

When users spend $1 on Avalanche, 100% of transaction fees are burned (removed from supply). Validators earn zero from fees, instead receiving rewards from newly minted AVAX through inflation. Avalanche operates on $1-2B annually in external funding from the Avalanche Foundation, subnet incentives, and VC investments, creating a deflationary network sustained by external capital rather than fee redistribution.

## Avalanche - Deflationary with High External Funding

**When a user pays $1 in Avalanche fees:**

### Direct Fee Recipients
- **Token Burn**: $1.00 (100% of fees burned via deflationary mechanism¹)
- **Validators**: $0.00 from fees (rewards from inflation only)

The complete fee burning mechanism creates deflationary pressure, with validators compensated through inflation rather than fee sharing.

### Validator Funding
- **AVAX Staking Rewards**: Up to 7.65% APY from token inflation²
- **Daily Validator Payments**: ~$280,000 from new token issuance
- **No Fee Revenue**: All transaction fees permanently burned

### Foundation and VC Funding
- **Avalanche Foundation**: $200-500M for ecosystem development³
- **Subnet Incentives**: $100-300M for custom blockchain development⁴
- **Ava Labs**: $350M+ raised for core development⁵

### Token Unlock Schedule
- **Annual Token Unlocks**: $1-2B annually in programmatic releases (October 2025 data⁶)
  - **Staking Rewards**: 187.7M AVAX unlocking ($5.68B remaining, 30% unlocked)
  - **Team Allocation**: 72M AVAX ($2.18B remaining, 10% unlocked)
  - **Community**: 50.4M AVAX ($1.52B remaining, 30% unlocked)
  - **Strategic Partners**: 36M AVAX ($1.09B remaining, 80% unlocked)

**External Funding**: $3-4B annually beyond user fees (Foundation ecosystem: $200-500M + Subnet incentives: $100-300M + Ava Labs development: $350M+ + Token unlocks: $1-2B + Additional VC investments: $350-850M)

## User Types and Fee Distribution

### 1. Retail User (Simple Transfer)
**Transaction Type**: AVAX or token transfer between wallets

**$1 Fee Breakdown**:
- **100% BURNED** - All fees permanently removed from AVAX supply
  - Base fee: BURNED
  - Priority fee: BURNED (unlike Ethereum where tips go to validators)
  - Zero to validators directly
  - Creates deflationary pressure

**Post-Avalanche9000 Changes**:
- 96% reduction in minimum base fee
- Continued deflationary impact
- Lower costs for users

### 2. DeFi User (Swap Transaction)
**Transaction Type**: Token swap on DEX (Trader Joe, Pangolin)

**$1 Onchain Fee Breakdown**:
- **Network fees (100% burned)**: ~$0.02-0.10
- **Additional Protocol Fees**:
  - 0.25-0.3% swap fee → Liquidity Providers
  - Platform fee → Protocol treasury

**Total Cost Structure**:
- Network fees: $0.05 → BURNED
- Protocol fees: $0.95 → LPs and DEX platforms

### 3. Developer/Protocol Deployment
**Transaction Type**: Smart contract deployment and operation

**$1 Onchain Fee Breakdown**:
- **Deployment Gas**: 100% → BURNED
- **Ongoing Operations**: All fees burned
- **No Recycling**: Zero fee capture by any party

**External Support**:

## 100% Fee Burn Mechanism

**How It Works**:
- All transaction fees on Primary Network are burned⁶
- Both base fee and priority fee burned (unlike Ethereum)
- Creates deflationary pressure on AVAX supply
- Counterbalances validator inflation rewards

**Burn Statistics (2024)**:
- **Total burned**: 4.1M+ AVAX tokens
- **Annual burn rate**: ~1.2M tokens (0.337% of supply)
- **Post-Avalanche9000**: 96% fee reduction but maintained burn mechanism

**Deflationary Impact**:
- Reduces AVAX circulating supply continuously
- No fee recycling to any party
- Pure wealth transfer from users to all token holders via scarcity

## Validator Economics and Inflation Model

**Revenue Model**:
- **Zero from transaction fees** (all burned)
- **Staking rewards only**: Up to 7.65% APY on staked AVAX
- **Delegation fees**: Validators can charge delegators

**Staking Requirements**:
- **Primary Network**: 2000 AVAX minimum stake
- **Delegation**: 25 AVAX minimum
- **Uptime requirements**: 80% minimum for rewards

**Daily Economics**:
- **Total validator rewards**: ~$280,000 daily from inflation
- **No fee supplementation**: Pure inflation-based compensation
- **Staking participation**: ~70% of AVAX supply staked

**Token Release Context**:
- **Unlocked supply**: 514.4M AVAX ($15.56B at $30.63)
- **Staking rewards unlock**: 187.7M AVAX remaining ($5.68B)
- **Team unlock schedule**: 72M AVAX remaining ($2.18B)
- **Annual unlock rate**: $1-2B in programmatic releases

## Key Insights

1. **Pure Burn Model**: 100% of fees burned
2. **External Funding Dependency**: $1-2B annually in foundation and VC support
3. **Inflation-Funded Validators**: Zero fee revenue, pure inflation rewards
4. **Subnet Flexibility**: Custom economics possible on application-specific chains
5. **Post-9000 Changes**: 96% fee reduction maintains burn while reducing costs

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary**: Avalanche burns 100% of transaction fees while compensating validators through inflation rewards (up to 7.65% APY). This burn model is sustained by $3-4B annually in external funding including Avalanche Foundation ecosystem development ($200-500M), subnet incentives ($100-300M), Ava Labs core development funding ($350M+), and programmatic token unlocks ($1-2B annually through 2030). The 2024 Avalanche9000 upgrade reduced fees by 96% while maintaining complete fee burning, creating deflationary pressure supported by external capital and scheduled token releases rather than fee redistribution, differentiating Avalanche from fee-sharing networks by trading validator fee revenue for token holder scarcity benefits.

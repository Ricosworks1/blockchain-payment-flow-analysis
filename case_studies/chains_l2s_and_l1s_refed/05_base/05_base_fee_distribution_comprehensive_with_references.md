# Base Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary

Base operates as Coinbase's corporate-controlled Layer 2, capturing 80-100% profit margins from user fees while providing minimal value redistribution to the ecosystem. In 2024, Base generated $92M revenue ($360M annualized rate by late 2024) with settlement costs of only $10-15M, representing the highest extraction efficiency among major L2s. Unlike community-governed alternatives, Base's fees flow directly to Coinbase's corporate treasury, making it a pure revenue generator rather than an ecosystem development tool.

## Key Insights

1. **Highest Corporate Extraction**: 80-95% fee capture among major L2s
2. **Pure Profit Model**: No community redistribution or ecosystem funding
3. **Corporate Integration**: Unique retail and institutional access through Coinbase
4. **Regulatory Clarity**: Benefits from Coinbase's compliance framework
5. **Sustainable Margins**: 80-100% profit margins sustained through 2024

## Executive Summary Conclusion

Base represents the most efficient corporate value extraction model among Ethereum Layer 2s, capturing 80-95% of user fees ($360M+ annualized) as direct profit to Coinbase's treasury. Unlike community-governed alternatives that redistribute surplus to ecosystem development, Base operates as a pure revenue generator with 80-100% profit margins. While users benefit from Coinbase integration (100M+ user access, seamless fiat conversion, regulatory clarity), the model raises questions about fair value distribution in blockchain infrastructure. The system demonstrates how corporate-controlled sequencers can achieve maximum extraction efficiency but at the cost of community ownership and ecosystem reinvestment that characterizes other major L2 platforms.

# StarkNet Money Flow Analysis: The STARK-Proof Foundation Model

## Executive Summary

StarkNet operates a foundation-controlled revenue model where sequencer fees flow to ecosystem development while transitioning to decentralized governance through STRK token economics and validator staking launched in November 2024. With 127.5 TPS record performance, $252 million TVL (+550% YTD), and 168% ecosystem growth to 193 projects, the network demonstrates sustainable scaling through STARK-proof technology that eliminates trusted setups while providing quantum resistance [^1][^2]. The revolutionary v0.14.0 upgrade introduces Tendermint consensus with three decentralized sequencers, reducing block times to 6 seconds and establishing foundation for true decentralization by end of 2025 [^3]. StarkNet's unique position leverages Cairo smart contracts optimized for proof generation, $50+ million ecosystem funding programs including DeFi Spring (90 million STRK), and Layer 3 appchain infrastructure enabling application-specific scaling solutions [^4][^5].

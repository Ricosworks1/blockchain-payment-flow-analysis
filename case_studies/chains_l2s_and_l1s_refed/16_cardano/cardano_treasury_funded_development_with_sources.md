# Cardano - Treasury-Funded Development

## When a user pays $1 in Cardano fees:

When users spend $1 on Cardano, fees flow entirely to stake pool operators (100%) through the eUTXO-based fee model, has smart contracts[^1]. Cardano operates a treasury-funded development model where ecosystem funding comes from inflation, creating $700M-1B annually in development resources[^2], while the eUTXO model enables parallel processing and predictable fee calculation without MEV concerns[^3].

### Direct Fee Recipients
- **Stake Pool Operators**: $1.00 (100% of fees via Ouroboros consensus)[^4][^5]

### Treasury Distribution
- **Cardano Treasury**: 1.5B+ ADA (~$500M) from inflation, not fees[^6][^7]
- **Block Rewards**: 340 ADA per block to pools from treasury[^8][^9]
- **Project Catalyst**: $50-100M annually in community grants[^10][^11]

### Ecosystem Recipients
- **IOHK/Input Output**: $100-200M annually for core development[^12][^13]
- **Cardano Foundation**: $50-100M annually for adoption and partnerships[^14][^15]
- **Emurgo**: Commercial arm funding for enterprise solutions[^16][^17]

## Treasury-Based Funding

$700M-1B annually from token inflation (Quarterly burns: $0 Ã— 4 = $0 + Treasury distribution: $500M + Ecosystem development: $100-300M + Research funding: $100-200M)

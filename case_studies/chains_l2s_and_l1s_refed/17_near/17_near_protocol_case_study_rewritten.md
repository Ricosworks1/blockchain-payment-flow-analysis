# Near Protocol Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary
When users spend $1 on Near Protocol, fees flow to validators (~30%) and are burned (~70%) through the unique account rent model and sharded Proof-of-Stake architecture. Near's innovative approach combines predictable storage costs through account rent with dynamic gas fees, while the Nightshade sharding protocol enables parallel transaction processing across multiple shards. This analysis traces fee distribution across Near's developer-friendly, infinitely scalable blockchain architecture.

## User Types and Fee Distribution

### 1. DeFi User (Ref Finance, Burrow)
**Transaction Type**: Token swaps and lending on Near DEXs

**$1 Fee Breakdown**:
- **Validators (~30%)**: $0.30 for block production and consensus
- **Protocol burn (~70%)**: $0.70 burned to reduce NEAR supply
- **Account rent**: Separate storage costs for state maintenance

**Typical DeFi Costs**:
- **Simple swap**: $0.01-0.05 in gas fees
- **Complex DeFi**: $0.05-0.20 depending on contract complexity
- **Account creation**: $0.10-0.50 for new account registration
- **Storage staking**: $1-5 for contract state storage

**Sharding Benefits**:
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple shards process transactions simultaneously
- **Linear scaling**: More shards = higher throughput
- **Cross-shard composability**: DeFi protocols work across shards

### 2. Web3 Developer (JavaScript/Rust)
**Transaction Type**: Smart contract deployment and application development

**$1 Onchain Fee Breakdown**:
- **Gas costs**: $0.20-0.50 for contract deployment
- **Storage staking**: $2-20 for contract state storage
- **Account rent**: Ongoing costs for maintaining contract accounts

**Development Advantages**:
- **Web2 familiar**: JavaScript SDK and familiar development tools
- **Account model**: Human-readable account names (alice.near)

**Revenue Streams**:
- **Block rewards**: Fixed NEAR inflation distributed to validators
- **Transaction fees**: 30% of user gas fees
- **Chunk production**: Fees from producing shard chunks
- **Nightshade rewards**: Additional incentives for cross-shard communication

**Validator Economics**:
- **Minimum stake**: Dynamic threshold based on total staked amount
- **Seat auctions**: Validators compete for limited consensus seats
- **Slashing conditions**: Penalties for double-signing or extended downtime

### 4. NEAR Staker/Delegator
**Transaction Type**: Delegating NEAR to validators

**Revenue Model**:
- **Staking rewards**: 8-12% APY from protocol inflation

## Near's Unique Account and Storage Model

**Account Rent System**:
- **Storage staking**: Lock NEAR tokens to pay for account storage
- **Predictable costs**: 1 NEAR per 100KB of storage
- **Automatic cleanup**: Unused accounts freed after rent expires
- **Implicit accounts**: Temporary accounts for simple operations

**Human-Readable Accounts**:
- **Named accounts**: alice.near instead of hex addresses
- **Subaccounts**: app.alice.near for application-specific accounts
- **Account recovery**: Social recovery and account management tools

**Storage Economics**:
```
storageStake = stateSize Ã— 0.01 NEAR per 100 bytes
```

**Benefits over Other Models**:
- **State bloat prevention**: Economic incentives to clean up unused state
- **Predictable costs**: Fixed storage pricing vs auction-based gas markets
- **User experience**: Human-readable addresses and account recovery

## Nightshade Sharding Architecture

**Sharding Model**:
- **State sharding**: Different shards maintain different account states
- **Transaction processing**: Parallel execution across multiple shards
- **Cross-shard communication**: Receipts enable shard interaction
- **Dynamic resharding**: Network adjusts shard count based on demand

**Economic Benefits**:
- **Linear scalability**: More shards enable higher transaction throughput
- **Fee reduction**: Increased capacity reduces congestion and fees
- **Validator distribution**: Validators participate across multiple shards

**Consensus Mechanism**:
- **Doomslug**: Fast block production with 1-2 second finality
- **Threshold signatures**: Cryptographic verification of shard states
- **Fishermen**: Network participants monitor for malicious behavior

## Fee Distribution and Burning Mechanism

**Gas Fee Allocation**:
- **Validators (30%)**: Reward for block and chunk production
- **Protocol burn (70%)**: Permanently remove NEAR from circulation
- **No MEV extraction**: Deterministic transaction ordering

**Burning Benefits**:
- **Deflationary pressure**: Network usage reduces NEAR supply
- **Value accrual**: Increased usage benefits all NEAR holders
- **Economic sustainability**: Balances inflation with usage-based burning

**Dynamic Supply**:
- **Inflation**: 5% annual inflation for validator rewards
- **Burning**: 70% of fees burned, reducing circulating supply
- **Net effect**: High usage makes NEAR deflationary

## Progressive Security Model

**Account Types**:
- **Named accounts**: Full security with human-readable names
- **Implicit accounts**: Temporary accounts derived from public keys
- **Contract accounts**: Smart contract accounts with programmable logic

**Security Levels**:
- **Social recovery**: Account recovery through trusted contacts
- **Hardware wallet**: Integration with Ledger and other hardware wallets
- **Multisig**: Multi-signature account control
- **Progressive onboarding**: Start simple, add security as needed

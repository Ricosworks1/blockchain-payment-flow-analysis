# NEAR Money Flow Analysis: The Sharded Fee-Burn Model

## Executive Summary

NEAR Protocol operates a distinctive fee distribution model where 30% of transaction fees flow to validators while 70% are permanently burned, creating deflationary pressure supported by the innovative Nightshade 2.0 sharding architecture that achieved 5x throughput improvements in 2024. With $2.11 million quarterly revenue (+26.81% QoQ), 7.42 million average daily transactions, and $240.16 million DeFi TVL, the network demonstrates sustainable growth through its account-based storage staking system and developer-friendly JavaScript SDK targeting 20 million Web2 developers [^1][^2]. The unique combination of human-readable accounts, predictable storage costs, and cross-chain compatibility through Aurora EVM creates comprehensive Web3 infrastructure while Nightshade 2.0's stateless validation reduces validator hardware requirements and increases network decentralization [^3][^4]. NEAR's strategic transition to chain abstraction and User-Owned AI positions the platform for billion-user adoption through simplified Web2.5 onboarding experiences powered by $13 million ecosystem funding initiatives [^5].

## 1. Fee Distribution and Burning Mechanism

### 30/70 Validator-Burn Split

NEAR implements a unique fee distribution system that balances validator incentives with deflationary token economics.

**Data point:** 30% of transaction fees flow to validators for block production while 70% are permanently burned to reduce circulating supply
[^6]

**Data point:** Average transaction fee of $0.0031 in Q4 2024 (+15.91% QoQ) provides predictable cost structure for users
[^1]

**Data point:** Fee burning mechanism reduces effective inflation from 5% annually to approximately 3% during high network activity periods
[^7]

### Storage Staking System

NEAR's account model requires storage staking separate from transaction fees, preventing state bloat while ensuring sustainable network growth.

**Data point:** Storage staking locks NEAR tokens based on data stored, with 1 NEAR required per 100KB of storage
[^8]

**Data point:** Account creation requires 0.1 NEAR funding with additional 0.35 NEAR reserved for fees and storage
[^8]

**Data point:** Storage-staked tokens become unavailable for other uses, increasing validator yield by reducing circulating supply

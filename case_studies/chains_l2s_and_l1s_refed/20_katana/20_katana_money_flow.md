# Katana Money Flow Analysis: The Gaming-Optimized Ecosystem Model

## Executive Summary

Katana operates as the primary DEX on Ronin blockchain, maintaining 99% of the network's $147 million DeFi TVL while serving a gaming-focused ecosystem led by Sky Mavis that prioritizes user experience through subsidized operations and ultra-low transaction costs. With over 2 million daily active users driven primarily by Pixels (1.5 million DAU) and expanding beyond Axie Infinity, Ronin demonstrates sustainable gaming infrastructure through Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus supporting 22 validators and RON staking rewards ranging from 15.94% to 23.79% APR [^1][^2]. The network's transition to permissionless smart contract deployment in 2024, integration with Chainlink CCIP for enhanced bridge security, and Ronin Forge incubator program ($50,000-$500,000 grants) position the ecosystem for broader Web3 gaming adoption [^3][^4]. Katana's evolution through V3 concentrated liquidity, 149% year-over-year TVL growth, and 0.30% trading fees (0.25% to LPs, 0.05% to Axie Treasury) creates sustainable revenue streams supporting the broader gaming ecosystem while maintaining cost efficiency for micro-transactions [^5][^6].

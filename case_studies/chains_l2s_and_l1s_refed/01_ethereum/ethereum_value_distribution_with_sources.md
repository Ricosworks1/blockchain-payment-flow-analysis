# Ethereum - Decentralized Value Distribution

## Overview
Ethereum burns 100% of the base fee under EIP-1559[^1], while validators earn the remaining priority fees ($0.10â€“$0.25) plus any MEV rewards, depending on network congestion and block composition[^2][^3]. The network shifted from deflationary to 0.7-0.8% 12 months trailing inflation post-Dencun upgrade (March 2024)[^4]. Annual ecosystem value flows total $6-10B, including ~$65M in chain revenue, $1-2B in MEV extraction[^5], ~$120-130M in Ethereum Foundation spending[^6], and $50-150M each for RPC, Infrastructure and oracle services[^7]. We witness that post-Dencun (April 2024), only ~40,000 ETH burns annually while 845,000 ETH is issued to stakers, resulting in net inflation of ~1M ETH ($4B) since April 2024[^8].

## When a user pays $1 in Ethereum fees:

### Direct Fee Recipients
- **Token Burn (EIP-1559)**: $0.80-0.90 (100% of base fees destroyed)[^1][^9][^10]
- **Validators**: $0.10-0.20 (priority fees + MEV share)[^2][^11][^12]
- **MEV Extractors**: $0.50-2.00 additional value captured per transaction[^5][^13][^14]

## Latest Inflationary Pressure

### Deflationary Pressure
- **~40K ETH burned annually**[^8][^15][^16]

### Staking Rewards
- **~973,000 ETH issued annually to stakers ($3.9B at $4,000/ETH)**[^17][^18][^19]

### Net Effect
- **Inflation of 933K ETH annually (0.8% rate) creating $3.7B in net dilution at $4,000/ETH**[^4][^20][^21]

## Ecosystem Funding Recipients

### Ethereum Foundation
- **$120-140M annually (average) for core development**[^6][^22][^23]

### Client Development
- **~$35M annually for all L1 R&D**[^24][^25][^26]

### Research Grants
- **$30-60M annually for protocol research**[^27][^28][^29]

### Ecosystem Grants
- **$44-61M annually for applications, tools and bd**[^30][^31][^32]

## Infrastructure Value Extraction

### Oracle Providers
- **$10-70M annually from Ethereum DeFi (opaque market)**[^33][^34][^35]
  - Note: Revenue data largely undisclosed; estimates based on TVS and usage patterns

### MEV Infrastructure
- **$1-2B annually total MEV value**[^5][^36][^37][^38]

### RPC Providers
- **$50-150M annually (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)**[^7][^39][^40][^41]
  - Note: Actual revenues not publicly disclosed; estimates based on customer base and pricing

### Indexing Services
- **$30-80M annually (The Graph, Dune Analytics)**[^42][^43][^44]
  - Note: Revenue estimates based on query volume and pricing models

## Total Ecosystem Value Flow

**~$5-8B annually beyond $65M chain revenue:**
- Staking rewards: $3.9B
- MEV extraction: $1-2B
- Ethereum Foundation: $120-140M
- Ecosystem grants: $50-100M
- RPC providers: $30-50M
- Oracle services: largely undisclosed
- Indexing services: $30-80M

## Major L1 Networks: Money Allocation Analysis

### Ethereum - Decentralized Value Distribution

**When a user pays $1 in Ethereum fees:**

#### Direct Fee Recipients

- **Token Burn (EIP-1559)**: $0.80-0.90 (100% of base fees destroyed)
- **Validators**: $0.10-0.20 (priority fees + MEV share)
- **MEV Extractors**: $0.50-2.00 additional value captured per transaction

The base fee mechanism burns 80-90% of user fees, creating deflationary pressure. Validators receive priority fees plus a share of MEV, while sophisticated actors extract additional value through sandwich attacks and arbitrage.

#### Token Holders Benefit

- **Deflationary Pressure**: ~40,000 ETH burned annually (post-Dencun rate)
- **Staking Rewards**: 973,000 ETH issued annually to stakers ($3.9B at $4,000/ETH)
- **Net Effect**: Inflation of 933K ETH annually (0.8% rate) creating $3.7B in net dilution at $4,000/ETH
- **Historical Context**: Ethereum was deflationary from the Merge until Dencun (April 2024); burns dropped 94% as L2 activity migrated off mainnet

The network transitioned from deflationary to slightly inflationary following the Dencun upgrade, which reduced L2 costs and mainnet activity.

#### Ecosystem Funding Recipients

- **Ethereum Foundation**: $150M annually (average) for core development
- **Client Development**: ~$35M annually for all L1 R&D
- **Research Grants**: $30-60M annually for protocol research
- **Ecosystem Grants**: $44-61M annually for applications and tools

Total foundation spending of $134.5M in 2024, with $600-700M spent over 3.5-4 years based on treasury management.

#### Infrastructure Value Extraction

- **Oracle Providers**: $50-150M annually from Ethereum DeFi (opaque market)
- **MEV Infrastructure**: $2-5B annually total MEV value
- **RPC Providers**: $50-150M annually (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode)
- **Indexing Services**: $30-80M annually (The Graph, Dune Analytics)

**Total Ecosystem Value Flow**: ~$8-12B annually beyond user fees

## Key Insights

1. **Burn Dominance**: 80-90% of fees burned creates strong deflationary pressure during high activity
2. **Inflation Shift**: Dencun upgrade (April 2024) reduced L2 costs, making ETH slightly inflationary
3. **MEV Scale**: $2-5B annual MEV extraction dwarfs direct validator rewards
4. **Foundation Efficiency**: $134.5M annual spending supports entire ecosystem development
5. **Infrastructure Costs**: Hidden $8-12B annual value extraction through various service providers

## Conclusion

Ethereum burns 80-90% of transaction fees through EIP-1559 while validators receive 10-20% plus MEV share. The network operates at 0.8% annual inflation following the Dencun upgrade (April 2024), with the Fusaka upgrade scheduled for December 2025. Annual ecosystem value flows total $8-12B, including $3.9B in staking rewards, $2-5B in MEV extraction, $134.5M in Ethereum Foundation spending, and $50-150M each for RPC and oracle services. With only ~40k ETH burned annually versus 973k ETH issued to stakers, Ethereum operates as an inflation-funded network where fees cover minimal security costs.

# Optimism Money Flow Analysis: The Public Goods Funding Model

## Executive Summary

Optimism operates as Ethereum's leading optimistic rollup implementing a revolutionary public goods funding model through RetroPGF, generating over $40 million annually across its Superchain ecosystem while dedicating 100% of sequencer profits to community benefit rather than corporate extraction [^1]. The network achieved significant cost reductions in 2024 with average transaction fees falling 80% to $0.09 following EIP-4844 implementation, while maintaining $676.15 million Total Value Locked and $65.6 million daily DEX volume [^2]. Optimism's unique dual-governance system combines Token House (OP token holders) with Citizens' House (reputation-based) to allocate 859 million OP tokens ($618 million) reserved specifically for retroactive public goods funding [^3]. The Superchain revenue model enables sustainable ecosystem growth with Base contributing 2.5% of its $360 million annual revenue while 39 OP Stack chains collectively generate fees supporting continuous innovation funding [^4].

## Conclusion

Optimism represents a fundamental reimagining of blockchain economics, proving that network success can directly benefit public goods rather than corporate profits. With over $40 million in annual Superchain revenue and $676.15 million TVL, the network demonstrates strong market validation for its public benefit approach. The dramatic 80% fee reduction to $0.09 average transaction costs following EIP-4844 implementation showcases technical excellence while maintaining sustainable funding through operational efficiency.

The protocol's dual-governance system balancing OP token holders with reputation-based Citizens' House creates unprecedented accountability mechanisms for $618 million in public goods funding. The transition to continuous RetroPGF distribution in 2025 addresses builder consistency needs while maintaining impact-driven allocation principles.

Critical success factors include managing revenue sustainability as transaction costs continue declining, scaling the Citizens' House representation model globally, and executing the transition to decentralized sequencers while preserving public goods funding priority. The Superchain's 59.5% L2 market share with 39 participating chains validates the model's effectiveness in aligning network growth with community benefit.

The protocol's emphasis on sustainable public goods funding rather than profit maximization positions it uniquely among blockchain platforms, though long-term success depends on maintaining revenue growth sufficient to fund continuously expanding ecosystem development needs. Optimism's innovation in channeling 100% of sequencer profits to community benefit creates a foundation for sustainable Web3 infrastructure that prioritizes collective value over individual extraction.

# Optimism Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary

Optimism operates the world's largest Layer 2 ecosystem through its Superchain model, where sequencer profits from 39 OP Stack chains fund RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) rather than corporate extraction. With $40M+ total Superchain revenue and 859M OP tokens ($618M) allocated to public goods, Optimism demonstrates the most sustainable public goods funding model in crypto. The Superchain's 59.5% L2 market share creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem where network effects drive revenue growth, with Base alone contributing $9M annually alongside OP Mainnet's $11M, creating a $40M+ annual public goods funding pool that dwarfs traditional blockchain foundation models.

## Executive Summary Conclusion

Optimism's Superchain model represents the most successful sustainable public goods funding mechanism in blockchain infrastructure, generating $40M+ annually from 39 OP Stack chains while maintaining financial sustainability. With Base contributing $9M, OP Mainnet $11M, and other chains $20M+ annually, the Superchain has created a 2:1 revenue surplus that enables expanded public goods funding without deficit spending or corporate extraction. The RetroPGF model has distributed $100M+ equivalent to 500+ projects while controlling 59.5% of the L2 market, creating genuine network effects where ecosystem growth directly funds infrastructure development. Unlike Arbitrum's 35:1 deficit ratio or Base's 97% corporate extraction, Optimism's model proves that public goods funding can scale with network adoption, positioning the Superchain as the blueprint for sustainable blockchain ecosystem development where revenue growth and community benefit align rather than compete.

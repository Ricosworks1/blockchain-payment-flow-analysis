# Cosmos Money Flow Analysis: The Internet of Blockchains Model

## Executive Summary

Cosmos Hub operates a community-governed fee distribution model where approximately 98% of transaction fees flow to validators while 2% funds the community pool for ecosystem development, creating sustainable infrastructure for the Internet of Blockchains through IBC-enabled cross-chain operations. With 16.69% peak staking APR in 2024, $3.5 billion in annual IBC transfer volume across 115+ connected chains, and successful launch of shared security consumer chains including Neutron, the network demonstrates sustainable growth through multi-revenue stream economics [^1][^2]. The revolutionary Proposal 839 secured $5.7 million in community-funded development for 2024, marking transition from Interchain Foundation dependence to autonomous governance while Skip Protocol's acquisition positions Cosmos for accelerated ecosystem growth [^3][^4]. Cosmos's unique approach combines Tendermint consensus with liquid staking integration through Stride Protocol ($55 million TVL), Hydro automated liquidity management, and inflation rate optimization (reduced maximum from 20% to 10%) creating comprehensive blockchain infrastructure platform [^5][^6].

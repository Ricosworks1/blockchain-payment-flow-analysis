# Linea Money Flow Analysis: ConsenSys' zkEVM Layer 2 Model

## Executive Summary

Linea operates as ConsenSys' zkEVM Layer 2 solution, processing over 230 million transactions since its August 2023 mainnet launch while generating $39.2 million in fees in 2024 [^1]. The protocol currently operates under centralized ConsenSys control, capturing approximately 75% of user fees through sequencer operations while 25% flows to Ethereum L1 for data availability and proof verification [^2]. With $3.5 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) representing 14x growth since May 2025, Linea has emerged as the fastest-growing zkEVM on Ethereum [^3]. The platform launched its LINEA token in September 2025 with 85% community allocation and plans full decentralization by 2027, though current operations remain entirely ConsenSys-controlled [^4].

## 1. Protocol Architecture and Revenue Model

### zkEVM Technology Stack

Linea operates as a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) Layer 2 solution, providing Ethereum-equivalent execution with cryptographic proof verification.

**Data point:** Linea is 100% proven zkEVM rollup committed to full Ethereum equivalence with bytecode compatibility
[^5]

**Data point:** Transaction fees reduced 15-20x compared to Ethereum mainnet through zkSNARK proof compression
[^6]

**Data point:** Proprietary proof system uses Vortex → Arcane → PLONK compression for efficient L1 verification
[^7]

The protocol's architecture enables high throughput while maintaining Ethereum security guarantees through zero-knowledge proofs verified on Layer 1.

### Fee Capture Mechanism

Unlike decentralized Layer 2s, Linea's current model concentrates fee capture within ConsenSys' operational control.

**Data point:** Approximately 75% of user fees flow to ConsenSys for sequencer operations and infrastructure
[^2]

**Data point:** Remaining 25% of fees paid to Ethereum L1 for proof verification and data availability
[^2]

**Data point:** MEV extraction remains opaque under centralized sequencer control with no public metrics
[^8]

This centralized structure allows ConsenSys to capture the majority of economic value generated by network activity.

[^12]

**Data point:** Dependence on ConsenSys infrastructure creates vendor lock-in concerns
[^25]

**Data point:** Multi-year decentralization timeline extends trust assumptions beyond competitor timelines
[^20]

## Conclusion

Linea represents ConsenSys' strategic entry into the Layer 2 market, leveraging ecosystem advantages to drive adoption despite centralized operations. With $39.2 million in 2024 fee generation and $3.5 billion TVL, the network demonstrates strong market fit while capturing approximately 75% of user fees through ConsenSys-controlled infrastructure.

The September 2025 LINEA token launch with 85% community allocation signals commitment to eventual decentralization, though full permissionless operation remains targeted for 2027 and beyond. The platform's deep integration with MetaMask and Infura provides competitive advantages in user acquisition and developer tooling, offsetting higher transaction costs relative to competing Layer 2 solutions.

Critical challenges include transitioning from centralized to decentralized operations while maintaining performance, reducing transaction fees to competitive levels, and proving the sustainability of the economic model post-decentralization. The success of Linea ultimately depends on ConsenSys' ability to execute its decentralization roadmap while preserving the ecosystem synergies that drive current adoption.

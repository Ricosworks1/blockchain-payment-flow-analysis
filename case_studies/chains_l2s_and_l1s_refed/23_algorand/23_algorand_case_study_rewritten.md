# Algorand Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary
When users spend $1 on Algorand, fees flow to proposers and voters (~100%) through the unique Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism with no minimum stake requirements. Unlike traditional PoS networks, Algorand's cryptographically sortition-based consensus randomly selects validators for each round using Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), ensuring true decentralization while maintaining instant finality. This analysis traces fee distribution across Algorand's academic-grade, permissionless blockchain designed for enterprise adoption and DeFi applications.

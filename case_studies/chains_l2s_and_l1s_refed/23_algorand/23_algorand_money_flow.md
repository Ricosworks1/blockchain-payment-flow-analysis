# Algorand Money Flow Analysis: The Pure Proof-of-Stake Academic Model

## Executive Summary

Algorand operates a unique Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus model where 100% of the fixed 0.001 ALGO transaction fees flow directly to randomly selected block proposers through cryptographically secure Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), eliminating traditional validator delegation and minimum staking requirements. With 6,000 TPS capability, 2.8-second block times, and instant finality achieved through academic-grade consensus research, the network demonstrates superior technical performance while maintaining the lowest barrier to participation in blockchain consensus. The 2024 transition from governance rewards to continuous staking, $164.55 million DeFi TVL growth (135% increase from $70 million), and enterprise adoption through TravelX (112.5 million transactions) establishes foundation for sustainable economics without inflationary tokenomics or complex fee structures. Algorand's unique position leverages fixed supply of 10 billion ALGO tokens, post-quantum secure State Proofs technology for cross-chain interoperability, and flat fee structure providing predictable costs essential for enterprise payment rails and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) infrastructure.

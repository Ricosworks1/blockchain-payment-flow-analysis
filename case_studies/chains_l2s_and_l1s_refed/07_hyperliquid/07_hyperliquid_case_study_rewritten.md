# Hyperliquid Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary
When users spend $1 on Hyperliquid, fees flow primarily to the protocol treasury (~50-60%) and validators (~25-35%), with portions to market makers (rebates), liquidators, and HLP liquidity providers. As a purpose-built perp DEX L1 with its own consensus, Hyperliquid captures trading fees directly rather than relying on external fee sources. This analysis traces fee distribution across the integrated trading and consensus infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Hyperliquid presents a unique fee model where trading activity on a purpose-built perp DEX L1 generates revenue distributed between protocol treasury (~55%), validators (~30%), and ecosystem participants (~15%). Unlike general-purpose blockchains that rely on diverse applications for fee generation, Hyperliquid captures value directly from its core trading function. The integrated approach allows for sophisticated fee structures including maker rebates, liquidation incentives, and HLP pool revenue sharing. This model demonstrates how application-specific blockchains can optimize fee distribution for their particular use case, creating sustainable economics for both infrastructure providers (validators) and protocol development while maintaining competitive trading costs for users.

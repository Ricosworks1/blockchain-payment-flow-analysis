# Hyperliquid Fee Flow Analysis: Where Every Dollar Goes

## Executive Summary

Hyperliquid operates as the top revenue-generating blockchain, earning $3.7M daily ($1.35B annually) surpassing Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain. The protocol deploys 93-97% of revenue into daily HYPE buybacks ($1M daily), creating a self-sustaining model without traditional token inflation or VC funding. With $11-15B daily trading volume and 73% market share in decentralized perpetuals, Hyperliquid demonstrates actual profitability rather than subsidy dependence. However, the late 2025/early 2026 core contributor token unlock presents a significant test of sustainability.

## Hyperliquid - Purpose-Built DEX L1

**When a user pays $1 in Hyperliquid trading fees:**

### Direct Fee Recipients
- **HYPE Buybacks (Assistance Fund)**: $0.93-0.97 (93-97% for token buybacks¹)
- **HLP Liquidity Providers**: $0.01 (1% of trading revenue²)
- **Operations/Development**: $0.02-0.06 (remaining for protocol operations)

The unique model directs nearly all fees to token buybacks rather than validators, burning, or treasury accumulation.

### Trading Economics
- **Daily Trading Volume**: $11-15B (futures and spot combined³)
- **Daily Revenue**: $3.7M (top revenue blockchain⁴)
- **Annual Revenue**: $1.35B (at current run rate)
- **Daily Buybacks**: $1M worth of HYPE tokens⁵
- **Monthly Buybacks**: $18.79M from derivatives alone
- **Fee Structure**: 0.0225% average trading fee⁶
- **Market Share**: 73% of decentralized perpetuals volume⁷

### Token Unlock Schedule
- **Core Contributors Unlock**: 236.94M HYPE ($12.09B at current price) vesting through 2028⁸
- **Genesis Distribution**: 310M HYPE ($15.81B) - largely unlocked
- **Major Cliff**: Late 2025/early 2026 when core contributor vesting begins
- **Total Supply**: 1B HYPE tokens maximum
- **Current Circulating**: ~337M HYPE (33.7% of total supply)
- **Team Unlock Schedule**: 236.94M HYPE vesting through 2028 (23.8% of total)
- **Monthly Selling Pressure Post-Unlock**: ~$300-500M potential from gradual vesting⁹
- **Buyback Capacity**: Current $30M monthly buybacks can only absorb ~10% of potential selling
- **No VC/Exchange Allocations**: Pure community and team distribution¹⁰

**Protocol Profitability**: Actually profitable at $1.35B annual revenue with continuous buybacks, unlike subsidy-dependent chains

## Key Insights

1. **Revenue Leader**: Top blockchain by daily revenue at $3.7M
2. **Unique Model**: 93-97% of fees to buybacks, not validators or burning
3. **Actual Profitability**: $1.35B annual revenue from real trading activity
4. **Unlock Overhang**: $12B team tokens create massive selling pressure
5. **Sustainability Test**: Late 2025 unlock will test buyback model viability

## Executive Summary Conclusion

Hyperliquid represents a unique experiment in blockchain economics: a protocol that generates real revenue ($1.35B annually) from actual usage (trading) rather than subsidies, but faces a massive test when $12B in team tokens begin vesting in late 2025. The protocol's 93-97% fee allocation to buybacks creates continuous buying pressure, but current $30M monthly buybacks can only absorb ~10% of potential monthly selling from unlocks. This creates a critical inflection point where Hyperliquid must either grow trading volume 10x to maintain token price stability or face significant price pressure. Unlike other L1s dependent on external subsidies, Hyperliquid's challenge is managing internal token distribution while maintaining the profitability that sets it apart from the broader blockchain ecosystem.

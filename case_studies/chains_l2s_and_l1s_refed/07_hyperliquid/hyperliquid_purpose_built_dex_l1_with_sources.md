# Hyperliquid - Purpose-Built DEX L1

Hyperliquid operates as the top revenue-generating blockchain, earning $3.7M daily ($1.35B annually) surpassing Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain[^1]. The protocol deploys 93-97% of revenue into daily HYPE buybacks ($1M daily), creating a unique self-sustaining model without traditional token inflation or VC funding[^2]. With $11-15B daily trading volume and 73% market share in decentralized perpetuals, Hyperliquid demonstrates actual profitability rather than subsidy dependence[^3].

## Initial Findings Summary

### Preliminary Loss Ratio Analysis (TOP 10):
1. **Ethereum**: 2.6x (MODERATE LOSS - inflation-funded security model)
2. **Solana**: 10.7x (HIGH LOSS)
3. **BNB Chain**: 0.8x (PROFITABLE - aggressive burns)
4. **Bitcoin**: 153x (EXTREME LOSS)
5. **Base**: 0.04x (HIGHLY PROFITABLE - L2 model)
6. **Arbitrum**: 1,000x+ (EXTREME LOSS - token unlocks)
7. **Hyperliquid**: 0.15x (PROFITABLE - fee-driven model)
8. **Avalanche**: 4x (HIGH LOSS)
9. **Linea**: 1.6x+ (LOSS - pre-token subsidies)
10. **Sui**: 193x (EXTREME LOSS)

### Key Patterns Observed:
- **Established L1s** with high inflation (Bitcoin, Solana) show extreme loss ratios
- **Ethereum's** reduced burns shift to inflation-dependent security model
- **L2s** likely have different economics due to L1 data costs
- **Newer chains** may have undiscovered incentive programs

### Next Research Priorities:
1. Complete emission data for remaining 7 chains
2. Layer in protocol-level incentive programs
3. Research ecosystem grant spending
4. Analyze airdrop allocation patterns
5. Map institutional incentive flows

### Methodology Notes:
- Using daily periods for consistency
- Including both explicit token emissions and implicit subsidies
- Separating sustainable revenue from speculation-driven fees
- Tracking both chain-level and protocol-level incentives

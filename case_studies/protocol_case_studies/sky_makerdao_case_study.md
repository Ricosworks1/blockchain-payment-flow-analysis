# Sky (MakerDAO) Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Sky protocol (formerly MakerDAO) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Stability Fees
- **Recipient**: Sky protocol surplus buffer
- **Mechanism**: Interest on DAI/USDS loans
- **Distribution**: Protocol accumulation then distribution

### DAI/USDS Savings Rate (DSR/SSR)
- **Recipient**: DAI/USDS holders
- **Mechanism**: Yield paid from stability fees
- **Distribution**: Automatic accrual to holders

### Liquidation Penalties
- **Recipient**: Protocol and keepers
- **Mechanism**: 13% penalty on liquidated vaults
- **Distribution**: Majority to protocol, portion to keepers

### Real World Asset (RWA) Yields
- **Recipient**: Protocol surplus
- **Mechanism**: T-bill and loan returns
- **Distribution**: Direct to protocol revenue

## Core Recipients Analysis

### 1. DAI/USDS Holders (DSR/SSR)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Savings rate yield (5-8% currently)
  - Funded by stability fees
  - RWA yields pass-through
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic accrual
  - Compound interest

### 2. MKR/SKY Token Holders
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Surplus buffer overflow
  - Buy and burn mechanism (historical)
  - SKY farming rewards
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Token appreciation
  - Yield farming

### 3. Vault Users (Borrowers)
- **Revenue Sources**: None (they pay fees)
- **Costs**: Stability fees (5-15% APR)
- **Benefits**: Capital efficiency
- **Distribution**: Interest payments

### 4. SubDAO Allocators
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Allocated MKR/SKY rewards
  - Operating budgets
  - Performance incentives
- **Examples**: Spark, other SubDAOs
- **Distribution**: Governance allocation

### 5. Core Units/Contributors
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Operating budgets
  - Development grants
  - Service agreements
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Monthly budgets
  - Milestone payments

### 6. Liquidation Keepers
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Liquidation incentives
  - MEV opportunities
  - Dutch auction profits
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Competitive auctions
  - Performance-based

### 7. RWA Partners
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Origination fees
  - Service agreements
  - Management fees
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Legal structures
  - Off-chain agreements

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Revenue Generation Lifecycle
1. Users open vaults, mint DAI/USDS
2. Stability fees accrue on debt
3. RWA vaults generate yields
4. Fees flow to surplus buffer
5. DSR/SSR paid from surplus
6. Excess to MKR/SKY holders

### Fee Distribution Percentages
- **DSR/SSR Holders**: ~60-80% of revenues
- **Protocol Surplus**: ~20-40% retained
- **MKR/SKY Holders**: Surplus overflow
- **Operations**: ~$50-100M annual budget

## Financial Estimates

### Annual Revenue Breakdown (2024 estimates)
- **Stability Fees**: ~$150-250 million
  - From $5B+ in vaults
- **RWA Yields**: ~$100-200 million
  - T-bills and loans
- **Liquidation Penalties**: ~$10-20 million
- **Total Revenue**: ~$260-470 million

### Cost Structure
- **DSR/SSR Payments**: ~$150-250 million
- **Core Unit Budgets**: ~$50-70 million
- **SubDAO Funding**: ~$30-50 million
- **Development**: ~$20-30 million
- **Net Surplus**: ~$10-70 million

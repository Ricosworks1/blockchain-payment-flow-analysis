# Ethena Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Ethena protocol (USDe stablecoin) is distributed across core recipients based on official Ethena documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Staking Yield (sUSDe)
- **Recipient**: sUSDe stakers
- **Mechanism**: ETH staking yield + funding rate arbitrage
- **Distribution**: Auto-compounding to stakers

### Funding Rate Arbitrage
- **Recipient**: Protocol and sUSDe holders
- **Mechanism**: Delta-neutral ETH positions on CEXs
- **Distribution**: Captured spread to protocol

### Basis Trade Revenue
- **Recipient**: Protocol treasury and stakers
- **Mechanism**: Long spot ETH, short perp ETH
- **Distribution**: Positive funding captured

### Protocol Reserve Fund
- **Recipient**: Insurance fund
- **Mechanism**: Portion of yield for risk management
- **Distribution**: Reserved for negative funding periods

### 7. CEX Partners
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Trading fees from hedging
  - Funding rate payments
- **Distribution Mechanism**:

  - Prime brokerage services

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Revenue Generation Lifecycle
1. Users mint USDe with stETH/ETH
2. Protocol opens delta-neutral positions
3. Funding rates collected (usually positive)
4. ETH staking yield earned
5. Yield distributed to sUSDe stakers
6. Reserve fund accumulation

### Revenue Distribution Percentages
- **sUSDe Stakers**: ~70-85% of total yield
- **Insurance Fund**: ~15-30% of yield
- **Protocol Operations**: ~5-10%
- **ENA Holders**: 0% currently (governance only)

## Financial Estimates

### Annual Revenue Breakdown (2024 estimates)
Based on ~$3B TVL:
- **Funding Rate Revenue**: ~$200-400 million
  - Average funding: 8-15% APR
  - Variable with market conditions
- **ETH Staking Yield**: ~$100-150 million
  - ~4-5% staking APR
- **Total Protocol Revenue**: ~$300-550 million
- **sUSDe Staker Distribution**: ~$210-385 million
- **Insurance Fund Allocation**: ~$45-110 million

### Yield Components
- **Base Staking**: 4-5% APR
- **Funding Arbitrage**: 5-25% APR (variable)
- **Combined sUSDe Yield**: 10-30% APR target

## Unique Characteristics

### Synthetic Dollar Design
- Not backed by fiat/T-bills
- Delta-neutral crypto positions
- Yield-bearing by default

### Risk Management
- Insurance fund mechanism
- Gradual mint/redeem scaling
- Custody segregation
- OES (Onchain Exposure System)

### Centralized Dependencies
- CEX custody requirements
- Off-chain collateral
- Authorized participant model

### Negative Funding Protection
- Insurance fund coverage
- Yield buffer system
- Risk parameter adjustment

## Competitive Dynamics

### Yield Advantage

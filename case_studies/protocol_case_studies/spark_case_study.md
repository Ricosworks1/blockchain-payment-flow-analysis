# Spark Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Spark Protocol (formerly Maker/DAI lending) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Interest Rate Spread
- **Recipient**: SparkDAO treasury (SubDAO of MakerDAO)
- **Mechanism**: Difference between borrow and supply rates
- **Distribution**: Reserve factor accumulation

### DAI Savings Rate (DSR) Integration
- **Recipient**: DAI depositors
- **Mechanism**: Direct DSR pass-through from Maker
- **Distribution**: Automatic yield to DAI suppliers

### Liquidation Penalties
- **Recipient**: Liquidators and protocol
- **Mechanism**: 5-10% penalty on liquidations
- **Distribution**: Majority to liquidators, portion to treasury

### Flash Loan Fees
- **Recipient**: Protocol treasury
- **Mechanism**: 0.09% fee on flash loans
- **Distribution**: 100% to protocol

## Core Recipients Analysis

### 1. DAI Suppliers
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - DAI Savings Rate (DSR)
  - Enhanced yield from borrower interest
  - sDAI appreciation
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic DSR accrual
  - Real-time interest

### 2. Non-DAI Suppliers
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Variable supply rates
  - Interest from borrowers
  - Liquidity incentives
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Pro-rata to supplied assets
  - Market-based rates

### 3. SparkDAO Treasury
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Reserve factor (10-20%)
  - Flash loan fees
  - Liquidation fees portion
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic accumulation
  - MakerDAO governance control

### 4. MKR Token Holders
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Indirect via MakerDAO governance
  - Control over Spark parameters
  - Treasury management rights
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Parent DAO governance
  - Strategic decisions

### 5. Liquidators
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Liquidation bonuses (5-10%)
  - MEV opportunities
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Competitive liquidations
  - Bot operations

### 6. Phoenix Labs (Service Provider)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Development grants from MakerDAO
  - Service agreements
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Milestone-based payments
  - Ongoing maintenance

### 7. Borrowers
- **Revenue Sources**: None (they pay interest)
- **Costs**: Variable/stable borrow rates
- **Benefits**: Capital efficiency

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Revenue Generation Lifecycle
1. Users supply assets (especially DAI)
2. DAI earns DSR automatically
3. Borrowers pay interest rates
4. Spread captured by protocol
5. Reserve factor to treasury
6. Liquidations generate penalties

### Fee Distribution Percentages
- **Suppliers**: ~80-90% of interest revenue
- **SparkDAO Treasury**: ~10-20% reserve factor
- **Liquidators**: 100% of liquidation bonuses
- **MakerDAO**: Governance control, indirect value

## Financial Estimates

### Annual Revenue Breakdown (2024 estimates)
Based on ~$2.5B TVL:
- **Total Interest Generated**: ~$100-150 million
  - Borrow interest paid
  - DSR costs covered by Maker
- **Protocol Revenue**: ~$15-25 million
  - Reserve factor capture
  - Flash loan fees
- **Supplier Earnings**: ~$85-125 million
  - DAI: DSR rate (~5-8%)
  - Other assets: variable

### DSR Subsidy from Maker
- **Annual DSR Cost**: ~$150-200 million
- **Covered by**: MakerDAO revenues
- **Net benefit**: Enhanced DAI yields

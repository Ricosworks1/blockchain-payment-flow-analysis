# Aave Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Aave protocol is distributed across core recipients based on official Aave documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Interest Rate Spread
- **Recipient**: Reserve Factor to DAO Treasury
- **Mechanism**: Portion of borrower interest payments
- **Distribution**: 10-35% depending on asset risk

### Flash Loan Fees
- **Recipient**: Split between protocol and liquidity providers
- **Mechanism**: 0.09% fee (0.05% to LPs, 0.04% to treasury)
- **Distribution**: Automatic on-chain distribution

### Liquidation Penalties
- **Recipient**: Liquidators and protocol
- **Mechanism**: 5-15% penalty on liquidated collateral
- **Distribution**: Majority to liquidators, portion to treasury

### GHO Stablecoin Revenue
- **Recipient**: Aave DAO Treasury
- **Mechanism**: 100% of GHO borrow interest
- **Distribution**: Direct to treasury

## Core Recipients Analysis

### 1. Liquidity Providers (Depositors)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Variable/stable interest from borrowers
  - Flash loan fees (0.05%)
  - aToken appreciation
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Real-time interest accrual
  - Pro-rata to supplied liquidity

### 2. Aave DAO Treasury
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Reserve factor (10-35% of interest)
  - Flash loan fees (0.04%)
  - GHO stablecoin revenue (100%)
  - Liquidation bonus portion
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic collection
  - DAO governance control

### 3. AAVE Token Stakers (Safety Module)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Safety incentives (AAVE emissions)
  - Protocol fee distribution (proposed)
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Staking rewards
  - Risk-adjusted returns

### 4. Liquidators
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Liquidation bonuses (5-15%)
  - MEV opportunities
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Competitive liquidation
  - Bot operators

### 5. Borrowers
- **Revenue Sources**: None (they pay interest)
- **Cost**: Variable/stable interest rates
- **Distribution**: Interest paid to protocol

### 6. Service Providers
- **Revenue Sources**: DAO grants and payments
- **Mechanism**: Development and maintenance
- **Distribution**: Governance proposals

### 7. Risk DAO Partners
- **Revenue Sources**: Risk management fees
- **Mechanism**: Gauntlet/Chaos Labs partnerships
- **Distribution**: Service agreements

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Revenue Generation Lifecycle
1. Users deposit assets, receive aTokens
2. Borrowers take loans, pay interest
3. Interest split: LPs get majority, treasury gets reserve factor
4. Flash loans generate additional fees
5. Liquidations create penalty revenue
6. GHO borrowing adds treasury revenue

### Fee Distribution Percentages
- **Liquidity Providers**: ~65-90% of interest revenue
- **DAO Treasury**: ~10-35% of interest + flash loan fees + GHO
- **Liquidators**: 100% of liquidation bonuses
- **Safety Module Stakers**: ~550 AAVE/day emissions

# Morpho Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Morpho protocol is distributed across core recipients based on official Morpho documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Peer-to-Peer Interest Optimization
- **Recipient**: Matched lenders and borrowers
- **Mechanism**: Direct P2P matching, eliminating spread
- **Distribution**: Better rates for both sides

### Fallback Pool Interest
- **Recipient**: Unmatched users via Aave/Compound
- **Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to underlying pools
- **Distribution**: Pool rates minus optimization

### Protocol Fee (Currently 0%)
- **Recipient**: Morpho DAO (inactive)
- **Mechanism**: Potential future fee on improved rates
- **Distribution**: Currently 100% to users

### MORPHO Rewards
- **Recipient**: Users and liquidity providers
- **Mechanism**: Incentive distribution program
- **Distribution**: Usage-based allocation

## Core Recipients Analysis

### 1. Lenders (Suppliers)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - P2P matched rates (better than pools)
  - Fallback pool rates
  - MORPHO token rewards
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic rate improvement
  - Real-time matching

### 2. Borrowers
- **Revenue Sources**: Cost savings (lower rates)
- **Benefits**:
  - P2P matched rates (better than pools)
  - No additional fees
  - MORPHO rewards
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Automatic rate optimization

### 3. Morpho DAO Treasury
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Currently no protocol fees
  - MORPHO token allocation
  - Future fee potential
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Governance-controlled
  - Development funding

### 4. MORPHO Token Holders
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Governance rights only
  - No fee capture currently
  - Future value potential
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Voting power
  - Protocol control

### 5. Underlying Protocols (Aave/Compound)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Reduced volume due to P2P matching
  - Fallback liquidity fees
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Standard protocol fees
  - Unmatched liquidity only

### 6. Vault Curators (Morpho Blue)
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Performance fees on vaults
  - Management fees
  - Incentive rewards
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Vault-specific terms
  - Risk management fees

### 7. Risk Assessors
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Service fees from curators
  - Risk model licensing
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - B2B service agreements
  - Performance-based fees

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### P2P Matching Lifecycle
1. Lender deposits assets
2. Borrower requests loan
3. Morpho matches P2P when possible
4. Improved rates for both parties
5. Unmatched portion to pool
6. No protocol fee extraction

### Value Distribution (P2P Matched)
- **Lenders**: +20-50% better rates vs pools
- **Borrowers**: -20-50% lower rates vs pools
- **Protocol**: 0% fee currently
- **Users capture**: 100% of spread savings

## Financial Estimates

### Annual Value Creation (2024 estimates)
Based on ~$3B TVL:
- **Interest Rate Improvements**: ~$50-100 million
  - Saved/earned by users via P2P
  - Not protocol revenue
- **Protocol Revenue**: $0 (no fees)
- **User Benefits**: ~$50-100 million
  - Split between lenders and borrowers

### Morpho Blue Metrics
- **Total Markets**: 100+ lending pairs
- **Active Vaults**: 50+ curated vaults
- **Curator Fees**: ~2-10% of yield
- **Total Value**: ~$1.5B+

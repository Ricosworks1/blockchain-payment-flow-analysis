# Lagoon Finance Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Lagoon Finance protocol (yield farming and liquidity optimization) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and protocol mechanics.

## Revenue Structure

### Performance Fees
- **Recipient**: Lagoon protocol treasury
- **Mechanism**: 15-20% of generated yields
- **Distribution**: Automatic collection on harvested rewards

### Management Fees
- **Recipient**: Lagoon protocol
- **Mechanism**: 2% annual fee on assets under management
- **Distribution**: Continuous accrual

### Deposit/Withdrawal Fees
- **Recipient**: Liquidity providers and protocol
- **Mechanism**: 0.1-0.5% on entry/exit
- **Distribution**: Majority to remaining LPs, portion to treasury

### Harvest Rewards
- **Recipient**: Harvesters and protocol
- **Mechanism**: Bounty for compound transactions
- **Distribution**: Gas reimbursement plus incentive

## Core Recipients Analysis

- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Proportional to vault shares
  - Automatic reinvestment

### 2. Lagoon Protocol Treasury
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - 15-20% performance fees

  - Gas reimbursement
  - Performance incentives
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - First-come, first-served
  - Bot competition

### 6. Partner Protocols
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Increased TVL from Lagoon

### 7. Community Contributors
- **Revenue Sources**:
  - Bug bounties
  - Documentation rewards
  - Community incentives
- **Distribution Mechanism**:
  - Contribution-based
  - Governance proposals

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Yield Generation Lifecycle
1. Users deposit assets in vaults
2. Strategies deploy capital to yield farms
3. Yields harvested periodically
4. Performance fee taken on profits
5. Remaining yield auto-compounded
6. Management fee accrues continuously

### Fee Distribution Percentages
- **Vault Depositors**: 80-85% of yields
- **Protocol Treasury**: 15-20% performance + 2% management
- **Harvesters**: 0.5-2% of harvest value
- **Strategy Developers**: 2-5% of strategy revenue

## Financial Estimates

### Annual Revenue Breakdown (Hypothetical)
Based on $100M TVL:
- **Total Yields Generated**: ~$15-25 million (15-25% APY)
- **Performance Fees**: ~$2.25-5 million
- **Management Fees**: ~$2 million
- **Total Protocol Revenue**: ~$4.25-7 million
- **Depositor Returns**: ~$12.75-20 million

### Operating Costs
- **Development**: ~$1-2 million/year
- **Security/Audits**: ~$300-500k/year
- **Operations**: ~$200-400k/year
- **Marketing**: ~$500k-1M/year

# EtherFi Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by EtherFi protocol is distributed across core recipients based on official EtherFi documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Protocol Service Fee
- **Recipient**: EtherFi protocol treasury
- **Mechanism**: 10% of staking rewards
- **Distribution**: Split between treasury and node operators

### Staking Rewards
- **Recipient**: eETH holders and node operators
- **Mechanism**: ETH validator rewards + MEV
- **Distribution**: 90% to stakers, 10% protocol fee

### Restaking Rewards (EigenLayer)
- **Recipient**: weETH holders
- **Mechanism**: Additional AVS rewards on top of staking
- **Distribution**: Pass-through after protocol fee

### Liquid Vault Fees
- **Recipient**: EtherFi treasury
- **Mechanism**: Management fees on vault strategies
- **Distribution**: Performance-based fees

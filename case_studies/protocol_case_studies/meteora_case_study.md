# Meteora Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Meteora protocol (Solana DEX and liquidity platform) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and on-chain data.

## Revenue Structure

### Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) Fees
- **Recipient**: Liquidity providers
- **Mechanism**: Variable fees based on volatility (0.01-2%)
- **Distribution**: 100% to LPs in active bins

### Dynamic Vaults Fees
- **Recipient**: Vault depositors and protocol
- **Mechanism**: Performance fees on yield strategies
- **Distribution**: Majority to depositors, performance fee to protocol

### Dynamic AMM Pools Fees
- **Recipient**: Liquidity providers
- **Mechanism**: Standard swap fees (0.25-1%)
- **Distribution**: Pro-rata to LPs

### Memecoin Launchpad Fees
- **Recipient**: Meteora protocol
- **Mechanism**: Launch fees and trading commissions
- **Distribution**: Platform revenue

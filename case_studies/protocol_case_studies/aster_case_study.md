# Aster Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Aster protocol (DeFi yield optimization) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and protocol mechanics.

## Revenue Structure

### Performance Fees
- **Recipient**: Aster protocol treasury
- **Mechanism**: 10-20% of generated yield
- **Distribution**: Automatic collection on profits

### Management Fees
- **Recipient**: Aster protocol
- **Mechanism**: 1-2% annual on AUM
- **Distribution**: Continuous accrual

### Strategy Execution Fees
- **Recipient**: Strategy developers and protocol
- **Mechanism**: Fee on automated transactions
- **Distribution**: Split between creators and protocol

### Liquidation Rewards
- **Recipient**: Liquidators and protocol
- **Mechanism**: Bonus on liquidated positions
- **Distribution**: Competitive liquidation system

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Yield Generation Lifecycle
1. Users deposit assets in vaults
2. Strategies deploy capital
3. Yields generated across protocols
4. Performance fee taken on profits
5. Remaining yield to depositors
6. Auto-compounding execution

### Fee Distribution Percentages
- **Depositors**: 80-90% of yields
- **Protocol Treasury**: 10-20% performance + 1-2% management
- **Strategy Developers**: 2-5% of strategy revenue
- **Keepers**: Gas + execution rewards

# Axiom Protocol Case Study: Dollar Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This case study analyzes how every dollar generated by Axiom protocol (ZK coprocessor for Ethereum) is distributed across core recipients based on official documentation and protocol mechanics.

## Revenue Structure

### Query Fees
- **Recipient**: Axiom protocol and provers
- **Mechanism**: Fee per ZK query execution
- **Distribution**: Split between protocol and compute providers

### Proof Generation Fees
- **Recipient**: ZK proof generators
- **Mechanism**: Computational work compensation
- **Distribution**: Based on proof complexity

### Callback Gas Fees
- **Recipient**: Axiom protocol
- **Mechanism**: Gas reimbursement plus margin
- **Distribution**: Protocol treasury

### Enterprise/API Fees
- **Recipient**: Axiom protocol
- **Mechanism**: Premium access and SLA guarantees
- **Distribution**: Direct protocol revenue

## Economic Flow Breakdown

### Query Lifecycle
1. Developer submits query with fee
2. Axiom processes historical data
3. ZK proof generated off-chain
4. Proof verified on-chain
5. Callback executed with results
6. Fees distributed to participants

### Fee Distribution Model
- **Proof Generators**: ~40-50% of query fees
- **Protocol Treasury**: ~30-40% of fees
- **Infrastructure**: ~10-20% of fees
- **Gas Costs**: Pass-through + margin

## Financial Estimates

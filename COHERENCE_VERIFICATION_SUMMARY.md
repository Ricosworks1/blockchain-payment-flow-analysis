## ✅ Verification Complete: All Files Now Coherent with PDF

### Summary of Changes Made

Following the user's selection of **Option 3** (reconcile both perspectives and clarify that both are correct), all documentation has been updated to present two complementary measurement approaches:

1. **Blockchain Base-Layer Analysis:** $3.1B fees → $120-170B costs → 97% subsidy rate
2. **Total On-Chain Revenue Analysis:** $13.7B revenue → $115-155B costs → 85-90% subsidy rate

```
Reconcile PDF and repository numbers: clarify dual measurement perspectives

- Update total ecosystem costs to $115-170B (unified range)
- Distinguish blockchain base-layer fees ($3.1B) from total on-chain revenue ($13.7B)
- Present subsidy rate as 85-97% (reflecting both measurement approaches)
- Add "Two Valid Perspectives" section to README
- Update all website pages for consistency with institutional PDF
```

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ **All files are now coherent with the institutional PDF report**

**Approach Taken:** Option 3 - Reconcile and explain that both numbers are correct with different measurement scopes

**Result:** The repository now clearly presents both measurement perspectives as valid and complementary, matching the institutional PDF's comprehensive approach. All numerical references have been updated to the unified $115-170B range, and revenue breakdowns are clearly distinguished between blockchain base-layer fees ($3.1B) and total on-chain revenue ($13.7B).

**User Feedback Integration:** Per user's explicit choice: "Let's go with option 3. I can then update the README, website, and GitHub About to match (as anyway, both are correct, just make sure it's clear)" - ✅ **Completed**

Comprehensive analysis of blockchain money flows: $115-170B annual subsidy economy (85-97% of costs) across 25+ networks
```

## Alternative Options

### Option 2 (More Detailed)
```
Analysis of blockchain payment flows across $4.3T market: $115-170B subsidy economy revealed. $3.1B blockchain fees vs $13.7B total on-chain revenue. 85-97% subsidy rate.
```

### Option 3 (Concise)
```
Blockchain payment flow analysis: $115-170B subsidy economy (85-97% of costs). 25+ networks, $4.3T market cap.
```

## Explanation

The updated range **$115-170B** (instead of $120-170B) reflects coherence with the institutional PDF report:

- **Lower bound:** $115B reflects total costs when using total on-chain revenue ($13.7B) as the baseline
- **Upper bound:** $170B reflects total costs when using blockchain base-layer fees only ($3.1B) as the baseline
- **Subsidy rate:** 85-97% captures both measurement approaches:
  - 85-90% when measuring against total on-chain revenue ($13.7B)
  - 97% when measuring against blockchain base-layer fees only ($3.1B)

Both perspectives are mathematically correct and complementary—they measure different scopes of the same phenomenon.
